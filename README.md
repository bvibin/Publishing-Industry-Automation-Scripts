# Publishing-Industry-Automation-Scripts
I specialize in automation of Adobe InDesign, Photoshop &amp; Illustrator through scripts.  I can deliver automation solutions themselves or final document layouts created with the scripts help, whatever is more appropriate for the job. Most of routine and time consuming tasks can be automated, so I can fit in tight timeframe, which is usually impossible with manual labour.   I Also like to share my knowledge with peoples who wants to learn, and I'm also open to learn from others.  Specialties: InDesign, Photoshop &amp; Illustrator workflow automation, work fast and thorough, book edition, eBook etc.
